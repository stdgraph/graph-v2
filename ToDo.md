### Issues
- [ ] SG19 Questions/Input
- [ ] csv_parser
  - [ ] CSVReader doesn't conform to the C++20 input_range or forward_range concepts; can't define load functions properly
    - [ ] What's missing? const types; other?
    - [ ] Author has acknowledged it could be valuable but hasn't made any commitments to do that
  - [ ] leading & trailing spaces for quoted values aren't ignored (std CSV format; author won't change)
  - [ ] can it be reused for multi-pass?
- [ ] Are the CSR vertex & edge types different? (requirement of incidence and adjacency concepts)
- [ ] Should operator\[\](n) -> vertex& be a requirement for a graph? (Used by NWGraph)
- [ ] Can std::array be used as a basis for a constexpr graph? What would the graph be?
- [ ] How to validate constexpr? (need to use std::array)
- [ ] CSR showed that there can be issues when an "edge" type is just an int, which is the same as the VId. Will this be an issue for existing graphs? If so, how to adapt them?
- [ ] Should we worry about row-major & column-major ordering of adjacency_matrix? always assume row-major?
- [ ] Is there a way for EVF to take both edge_value and fnc obj? (same for VVF & vertex_value)
- [ ] The default for edges(g,uid) CPO isn't being found by msvc or gcc. Is there a way to only have to override one version of edges(g,)?

### Issues Resolved
- [x] vertex_id(g,u) now takes a vertex reference (not iterator)
  - [x] how to define vertex_id_t without calling vertex_id()? 
  - [x] make it obvious it's unavailable for non-contiguous vertices
  - [x] Answer: for([uid,u] : vertices(g))
- [x] Best way to extend vol_graph to support different container types?
  - [x] Answer: graph_traits with template specializations for user-defined values. vol_graph renamed to dynamic_graph
- [x] What is the best dynamic graph to propose for the std? vol, vov? premature. Revisit later
- [x] Can an edgelist be trivially created by a user? (e.g. vector<pair<target_id,weight>>) yes; need to flush this out in paper
- [x] Can we drop the vertex_vertex_range in favor of just having vertexlist(g,u) [adjacency view]? yes
- [x] Can std::vector be used as a basis for a constexpr graph? No because we can't have variables of vector
- [x] Should CSR support source_id on edges (Sourced template parameter)? No. Views will be able to provide it so it won't be needed.
- [x] edge_list_graph (edgelist_edge<VId,E,EV> view?): edgelist is a view, or projection of a container
- [x] Are there any issues with using tag_invoke? It appears not. Others are using it in papers.
- [x] key vs. id? "key" is a better term, but id has been used extensively in boost and other graph libraries and will be easier for people to recognize
- [x] Do we need a run-time function to check for undirectedness, in addition to is_undirected_edge_v<EV>? Is it a run-time property for some graphs?
        A: We'll only support compile-time. If someone needs run-time they can create a wrapper for is_undirected_edge_v to use
- [x] Can CSR edges have a void value? (e.g. no v vector): yes
- [x] If we have an access namespace, do we need a container namespace? 
        A: "access" has been renamed "tag_invoke" and is a different purpose than a container namespace
           we don't need a separate container namespace
- [x] Are bfs & bfs algorithms, views or ranges? WRT P1709 they are Views.
- [x] Are graphs containers (WRT the standard)? 
        A: They are containers because they contain the data that is being operated on. They are more complex than 
        existing containers because they include multiple ranges.
- [x] Use of tag_invoke namespace is required by CPO and exposed when specializing the functions. Acceptable? Better way?
        A: It is a requirement and is being used as part of P2300. We'll follow their lead.
- [x] Can transform_view be used in place of the projections in the graph views? No
- [x] How to support bipartite (or N-partite) graphs using different vertex value types?
      A: Given a csr_graph, EV and VV can be tuples of the same length. 
         The number of elements in the tuples determine the number of partitions.
         Values are stored seprately from structure and can be stored in a tuple of vectors.
         Additional vectors are kept for the starting index in the vertices & edges structures for each partition.
         For instance, VV=tuple<int32_t,double,bool> and EV=tuple<int32_t, int32_t, void> the vertex values would be
         stored in tuple<vector<int32_t>, vector<double>, vector<bool>>, and the edge values would be stored as
         tuple<vector<int32_t>, vector<int32_t>, vector<void>>. (void may need to be replaced with a concrete novalue struct).
      B: Given a more standard adjacency structure, variant could be used instead of a tuple. For instance, using the same,
         EV and VV tuple types, they would be translated into variant<int32_t,double,bool> and variant<int32_t, int32_t, void>.
- [x] Should we have a graph_reference_t<G> type alias? Yes
